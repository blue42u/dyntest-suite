# Config file for everything

# Uncomment to enable proper OpenMP debugging for Valgrind tests. Usually you
# want this on, but its a pain to build so I leave it off usually.
# Generally this should be only turned on *after* doing a normal run to compile
# everything else first (GCC uses 2/3 of the cores of the machine).
#CONFIG_ENABLE_OMP_DEBUG=y

# Maximum number of threads to use for performance runs. If not specified the
# number of cores on the machine will be used, which may not be what you want.
#CONFIG_MAX_THREADS=NN

# Representative size-class for Valgrind test inputs, approximately from 1-3.
# Technically this is the maximum size-class for Memcheck and Massif, Helgrind
# is one less and DRD is two less. So 1 will do very little, 3 will run the
# minimal DRD, and 5 will run everything available (except extra inputs).
#CONFIG_VAL_CLASS=2

# Debugging options. Unless something goes horribly wrong (and/or you want to
# do some development), you don't need these.
#CONFIG_DEBUG_CONFIGURE=y
#CONFIG_DEBUG_MAKE_TRANSLATION=y
