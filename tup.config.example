# Uncomment to enable proper OpenMP debugging for Valgrind tests. The lib*omp
# in the given directory should be compatible with Valgrind, for GCC this

# number of cores on the machine will be used, which may not be what you want.
#CONFIG_MAX_THREADS=NN

# Size-classes for Valgrind test inputs, approximately from 1-3. 0 disables the
# test completely (since inputs have size-classes >= 1). Defaults are set to
# run Memcheck a lot and Helgrind a bit, DRD takes forever and the others are
# more specific.

# Repeatitions of the coarse performance testing to try and get better results.
# More data can be better, but too large and this takes forever.
# The default is set at 3 to get a small sample without going overboard.
#CONFIG_PERF_REP=3

# Toggle for detiled perf data. Default is on, but sometimes performance data
# isn't useful, for instance when doing other testing.

# Repeatitions for crash testing to try and break things. Default is disabled
# because normally Valgrind will give nicer results in the end.

# Disable all the internal inputs, leaving only the ones in /inputs*.

# Debugging options. Unless something goes horribly wrong (and/or you want to
